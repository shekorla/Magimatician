Old files from my senior coding class, wanted them backed up online.

These files are a game my classmates and I made for a final project in my highschool coding class. Most of the code is mine, excluding the shop code, and all of the art was made by my classmates. Feel free to learn from our project, but please give credit if you use anything. Since this project was created on school computers it cannot be used for comercial purposes.
